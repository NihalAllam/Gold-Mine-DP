# Gold-Mine-DP
In this mini project, we consider a simplified representation of a gold mine. The mine is represented as a grid of size n x m (here, 5x5), where each cell contains a positive integer representing the amount of gold (in tons) available at that position. <br>
The miner can start from any cell in the first (leftmost) column. From a given position (i, j), the miner can move to the next column using one of the following three moves:<br>
•	Right → (i, j + 1)<br>
•	Right-Up ↗ (i - 1, j + 1)<br>
•	Right-Down ↘ (i + 1, j + 1)<br>
The objective is to calculate the maximum amount of gold that the miner can collect when moving from the first column to the last column following these movement rules.
